    PTB calls ``process_update(update, coroutine)`` for every incoming update.

    ``do_process_update()``.

    For priority callbacks (``stop:*``, ``tapv:*``): we just ``await coroutine``
    -- runs immediately.
    For everything else: we acquire ``_sequential_lock`` first -- only one
    runs at a time.

    callback runs concurrently -> fires the ``asyncio.Event`` -> the watcher
    task inside ``execute_command()`` calls ``client.interrupt()`` -> Claude
    stops -> ``run_command()`` returns -> handler finishes -> lock released.

    A tool-approval callback (``tapv:*``) arrives while a text handler holds
    the lock, awaiting that same user's Allow/Deny click -> it must run
    concurrently too, or it would deadlock waiting behind itself.
